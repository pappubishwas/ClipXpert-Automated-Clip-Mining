## 📖 Abstract
ClipXpert is a new system that automates the extraction of relevant clips from YouTube videos using user-defined keywords or frequently used word or comment analysis. The system uses advanced transcription models to search a pre-existing database for lines associated with the provided keywords. If the database doesn’t contain the keywords, it dynamically identifies and stores relevant content for future use. ClipXpert also automates identifying frequently used nouns, adjectives, and adverbs to generate focused content highlights without user intervention. It also performs sentiment analysis on YouTube comments to understand audience engagement and reception. ClipXpert enhances video content extraction efficiency and accuracy, catering to the growing demand for targeted, high-value clips in the digital media landscape.
